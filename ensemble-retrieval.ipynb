Sometimes she calls every \\nhour until this writer returns her call. At times she is calm, easy to engage, and able to tolerate a \\n45-minute meeting. More often than not, she is visibly anxious and agitated, fidgeting in her seat \\nand asking, “Are we done yet?” She tends to change topics abruptly, particularly when \\ndiscussing something emotionally painful. \\n \\nAnn has difficulty expressing anger and coping with conflict. She finds conflict threatening and \\nfears retaliation, even when no real threat exists. Ann views most situations as threatening and \\nbecomes quite fearful, even in the absence of conflict. Ann has attempted employment on \\nnumerous occasions, but each time, she has been unable to maintain the job.

Ann worked initially \\nin food service: at a bakery and a restaurant in the Street Market.  She has also commercially \\ncleaned apartment buildings and casinos. Professional cleaning allowed her to interact minimally \\nwith others, but the job responsibilities caused her significant anxiety. Ann has had her LPN \\nlicense since 1989, but due to the demanding nature of the work, she “switched around a lot.”  \\nHer longest job was two years as an LPN. Her total time working in that field was roughly five \\nyears.  \\n \\nAnn has divulged that her biggest struggle while working is relating to her co-workers. She feels \\nmore comfortable alone than with the same people day after day. “I don’t trust people,” she \\nreports, and relates this to her long history of abusive relationships. She said jobs become more \\ndifficult the longer she works there because co-workers expect her to develop friendly \\nrelationships with them. Instead, she “overdoes it”, taking on “too much” which increases her \\ndepression and anxiety. She tends to take on more than she can handle in order to stay busy and \\navoid others. This keeps her anxiety and trauma triggers at bay. Eventually, however, she \\nbecomes overworked, stressed, and anxious.  \\n \\nIn December 2008, she was fired from a job and has been unable to return to work due to \\nincreased anxiety and depressed mood. Ann continues to express interest in employment, but her \\ncurrent mental health symptoms limit her ability to function in a work environment.
